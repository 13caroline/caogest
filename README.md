CaoGest is a progressive web application whose main purposes are to assist the user in managing registered kennels, as well as in finding their ideal dog for adoption.

## Development 

This platform was developed for **Informatic Labs IV** subject whose goals were to follow an iterative and incremental development throughout the project, outlining a holistic and flexible development strategy, allowing cohesion and progressive improvement of the team dynamics and its daily internal communication.

## Tools
* **Frontend**: Vue.js + Vuetify
* **Backend**: .NET Core with C#
* **Database**: MySQL Workbench
* **Deployment**: 
  * Microsoft Azure (_backend_)

## Market Study

Based on the surveys carried out, it was verified that only a tiny percentage of sites is able to provide some of the features proposed by our project, and none of them conglomerates them all. 
It was possible to find the following functions in different sites hosted in Portugal: possibility to register users, make donations, start an adoption process and apply for volunteering. It is believed that the lack of personalized search for dogs for adoption, as well as the availability and search for kennels by location contribute to the difficulty of adoption, and the consequent increase in kennel overcrowding.
